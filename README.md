# Hot Dog! It's a website

## Description

Created a site loosely based on Columbus' best hot dogs.


### Notes

The webpage can be viewed by simply opening the index.html page in your browser. I also used XAMPP to run it locally.

### In order to use XAMPP:

1. Visit https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html and download the 7.1.11 version for your system. 
2. Once it has been installed, clone the *hotdog* folder from github onto your desktop.
3. Copy the hotdog folder into *htdocs* under the new *XAMPP* folder.
4. Run XAMPP, Go to the *Manage Servers* tab and ensure that the *Apache Web Server* has started.
5. In your web browser type: *localhost/hotdog/index.html*
